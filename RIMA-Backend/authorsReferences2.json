Getting away from the traditional top-down approaches, the learner is more and more in control of selecting learning resources or choosing the right learning techniques. On the one hand, by following the idea of a learner-centric Personal Learning Environment it is now possible to freely design an own learning environment with all required tools to improve the learning process. On the other hand, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices such as smart phones or tablet computers creates the basis for new modern learning scenarios. While different applications for the devices already allow an individual aggregation of tools they are still highly separated and cannot interact beyond the borders of one application. In this paper, we present a new approach realizing application ecologies on mobile devices which allow integrating services and functionalities of one application into another one. This may happen ad-hoc without involvement of application developers resulting in high extensibility. Furthermore, it allows the user to adjust the app system according to his needs and creates the impression of one seamless mobile PLE consisting of an adjustable set of applications.", "year": 2015, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "99371136f37ef54cf39d0abeae20fff86b16c517", "authors": "U.

The learner is put into focus and offered general conditions for self-organized learning. At the same time mobile technology is becoming omnipresent and an essential part of today's learning. Although many (web) frameworks have been developed allowing the user to create his own PLE the mobile learner is not really reached. Although the mobile application architecture supports the PLE concept in general in the sense of aggregating different independent tools, the missing interrelations cause losses of contexts while switching between them. At the same time, necessary additional information cannot be presented in context as an enhancement creating added value. This paper introduces a concept for symbiotic interrelation and seamless integration of mobile applications as mobile personalizable learning environments where the user is in control of shap- ing his mobile learning environment seamlessly. Services and features of applications can be used inside one another and even across the borders of a single device. Thereby, contexts of one appli- cation can be used in further services and additional information can be visualized directly embed- ded where it is needed.

Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories.

One of the main goals of the integration of traditional teaching methods with technology enhancements is the improvement of teaching and learning quality in large university courses with many students. But does utilizing a VLE automatically improve teaching and learning? In our experience, many teachers just upload existing files, like lecture slides, handouts and exercises, when starting to use a VLE. Thereby availability of learning resources is improved. For improving teaching and learning it could be helpful to create more motivating, challenging, and engaging learning materials and e.g., collaborative scenarios to improve learning among large groups of students. Teachers could e.g., use audio and video recordings of their lectures or provide interactive, demonstrative multimedia examples and quizzes. If they put effort in the design of such online learning activities, they need tools that help them observe the consequences of their actions and evaluate their teaching interventions. They need to have appropriate access to data to assess changing behaviors and performances of their students to estimate the level of improvement that has been achieved in the learning environment. With the establishment of TEL, a new research field, called Learning Analytics, is emerging (Elias, 2011). This research field borrows and synthesizes techniques from different related fields, such as Educational Data Mining (EDM), Academic Analytics, Social Network Analysis or Business Intelligence (BI), to harness them for converting educational data into useful information and thereon to motivate actions, like self-reflecting ones previous teaching or learning activities, to foster improved teaching and learning. The main goal of BI is to turn enterprise data into useful information for management decision support. However, Learning Analytics, Academic Analytics, as well as EDM more specifically focus on tools and methods for exploring data coming from educational contexts. While Academic Analytics take a university-wide perspective, including also e.g., organizational and financial issues (Campbell & Oblinger, 2007), Learning Analytics as well as EDM focus specifically on data about teaching and learning. Siemens (2010) defines Learning Analytics as \"the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections, and to predict and advise on learning.\" It can support teachers and students to take action based on the evaluation of educational data. However, the technology to deliver this potential is still very young and research on understanding the pedagogical usefulness of Learning Analytics is still in its infancy (Johnson et al., 2011b; Johnson et al., 2012). It is a current goal at RWTH Aachen University to enhance its VLE--the learning and teaching portal L2P (Gebhardt et al., 2007)--with user-friendly tools for Learning Analytics, in order to equip their teachers and tutors with means to evaluate the effectiveness of TEL within their instructional design and courses offered. These teachers still face difficulties, deterring them from integrating cyclical reflective research activities, comparable to Action Research, into everyday practice. Action Research is characterized by a continuing effort to closely interlink, relate and confront action and reflection, to reflect upon one's conscious and unconscious doings in order to develop one's actions, and to act reflectively in order to develop one's knowledge.\" (Altrichter et al., 2005, p. 6). A pre-eminent barrier is the additional workload, originating from tasks of collecting, integrating, and analyzing raw data from log files of their VLE (Altenbernd-Giani et al., 2009). To tackle these issues, we have developed the \"exploratory Learning Analytics Toolkit\" (eLAT). \u2026", "year": 2012, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "3f204f1eaef37645f1d84ab784d813370704bca7", "authors": "U.

MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning.

Numerosas instituciones ofrecen una creciente variedad de MOOC. Sin embargo, existen m\u00faltiples retos que deben ser considerados al desarrollar MOOC, por ejemplo, la tasa de abandono de participantes en los cursos es del 95%. Una de las posibles razones para ello es la complejidad y la diversidad de los participantes en los MOOC.

We created eight experimental settings with combinations of these three user controls and conducted a between-subjects study (N=240), to explore the effect on cognitive load and recommendation acceptance for different personal characteristics. We found that controlling recommendations is the most favorable single control element. In addition, controlling user profile and algorithm parameters was the most beneficial setting with multiple controls. Moreover, the participants with high musical sophistication perceived recommendations to be of higher quality, which in turn lead to higher recommendation acceptance.

To mitigate this issue, diversity-enhanced user interfaces for recommender systems have in the past found to be effective in increasing overall user satisfaction with recommendations. However, users may have different requirements for diversity, and consequently different visualization requirements. In this paper, we evaluate two visual user interfaces, SimBub and ComBub, to present the diversity of a music recommender system from different perspectives. SimBub is a baseline bubble chart that shows music genres and popularity by color and size, respectively. In addition, ComBub visualizes selected audio features along the X and Y axis in a more advanced and complex visualization. Our goal is to investigate how individual traits such as musical sophistication (MS) and visual memory (VM) influence the satisfaction of the visualization for perceived music diversity, overall usability, and support to identify blind-spots. We hypothesize that music experts, or people with better visual memory, will perceive higher diversity in ComBub than SimBub. A within-subjects user study (N=83) is conducted to compare these two visualizations. Results of our study show that participants with high MS and VM tend to perceive significantly higher diversity from ComBub compared to SimBub. In contrast, participants with low MS perceived significantly higher diversity from SimBub than ComBub; however, no significant result is found for the participants with low VM.

This paper presents the initial results from a study whose primary objective is to empirically test those platforms' level of compliance with the so-called 'right to explanation'. Four research topics considered as gaps in existing legal and HCI scholarship originated from the project's initial phase, namely (1) GDPR compliance through user-centered design; (2) the inclusion of values in the system; (3) design considerations regarding interaction strategies, algorithmic experience, transparency, and explanations; and (4) technical challenges. The second phase is currently ongoing and allows us to make some observations regarding the registration process and the privacy policies of three categories of news actors: first-party content providers, news aggregators and social media platforms.", "year": 2019, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "a9fddccdc03fcf578dbbb89820ab9f4890579bf5", "authors": "J.

One approach is visual analytics, which integrates humans in decision\u2010making through visualizations that facilitate interaction with algorithms. Although many visual analytics systems have been developed for healthcare, a clear overview of their explanation techniques is lacking. Therefore, we review 71 visual analytics systems for healthcare, and analyze how they explain advanced algorithms through visualization, interaction, shepherding, and direct explanation.

At this point in time, the development of tools, technologies and methodologies that fully exploit the affordances of existing standards is more relevant than the development of new standards. Moreover, we believe that the relationship between technical standardization and research is often misunderstood: the main role of standards for research is to enable a large-scale technological infrastructure that promotes innovation through its open nature.", "year": 2008, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "262aa57fc3d3addbda64830b236f385af0790265", "authors": "K.

However, these systems are often presented to users as a \"black box\", i.e. the rationale for providing individual recommendations remains unexplained to users. In recent years, various attempts have been made to address this black box issue by providing textual explanations or interactive visualisations that enable users to explore the provenance of recommendations. Among other things, results demonstrated benefits in terms of precision and user satisfaction. Previous research had also indicated that personal characteristics such as domain knowledge, trust propensity and persistence may also play an important role on such perceived benefits. Yet, to date, little is known about the effects of personal characteristics on explaining recommendations. To address this gap, we developed a music recommender system with explanations and conducted an online study using a within-subject design. We captured various personal characteristics of participants and administered both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Results indicate that personal characteristics have significant influence on the interaction and perception of recommender systems, and that this influence changes by adding explanations. For people with a low need for cognition are the explained recommendations the most beneficial. For people with a high need for cognition, we observed that explanations could create a lack of confidence. Based on these results, we present some design implications for explaining recommendations.", "year": 2019, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "e7f9bfa23bcbe51c94dbcce3e59d9bf725b31f52", "authors": "E.

However, literature often adopts a one-size-fits-all approach for developing explanations when in practice, the type of explanations needed depends on the type of end-user. This research will look at user expertise as a variable to see how different levels of expertise influence the understanding of explanations. The first iteration consists of developing two common types of explanations (visual and textual explanations) that explain predictions made by a general class of predictive model learners. These explanations are then evaluated by users of different expertise backgrounds to compare the understanding and ease-of-use of each type of explanation with respect to the different expertise groups. Results show strong differences between experts and lay users when using visual and textual explanations, as well as lay users having a preference for visual explanations which they perform significantly worse with. To solve this problem, the second iteration of this research focuses on the shortcomings of the first two explanations and tries to minimize the difference in understanding between both expertise groups. This is done through the means of developing and testing a candidate solution in the form of hybrid explanations, which essentially combine both visual and textual explanations. This hybrid form of explanations shows a significant improvement in terms of correct understanding (for lay users in particular) when compared to visual explanations, whilst not compromising on ease-of-use at the same time.", "year": 2021, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "8bc39fface0bb9c9b146b66b470645c5bd0ca58c", "authors": "T.
