                        "In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in learning analytics (LA) in technology-enhanced learning (TEL). Generally, LA deals with the development of methods that harness educational data sets to support the learning process. Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining the indicators that help them achieve their goals. In this paper, we address the challenge of personalized LA and present the conceptual, design, and implementation details of a rule-based indicator definition tool to support flexible definition and dynamic generation of indicators to meet the needs of different stakeholders with diverse goals and questions in the LA exercise.",

Getting away from the traditional top-down approaches, the learner is more and more in control of selecting learning resources or choosing the right learning techniques. On the one hand, by following the idea of a learner-centric Personal Learning Environment it is now possible to freely design an own learning environment with all required tools to improve the learning process. On the other hand, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices such as smart phones or tablet computers creates the basis for new modern learning scenarios. While different applications for the devices already allow an individual aggregation of tools they are still highly separated and cannot interact beyond the borders of one application. In this paper, we present a new approach realizing application ecologies on mobile devices which allow integrating services and functionalities of one application into another one. This may happen ad-hoc without involvement of application developers resulting in high extensibility. Furthermore, it allows the user to adjust the app system according to his needs and creates the impression of one seamless mobile PLE consisting of an adjustable set of applications.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained a lot of attention in the last years as a new technology enhanced learning (TEL) approach in higher education. MOOCs provide more educational opportunities to a massive number of learners to attend free online courses around the globe. Discussions around MOOCs have been focusing on the potential, social, institutional, technological, relevance, and marketing issues and less on the quality design of MOOC environments. Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories. From these, the learning analytics and assessment categories were found to be the key features for effective MOOCs.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are providing opportunities for thousands of learners to participate in free higher education courses online. MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning. This cluster schema creates a meaningful picture for the MOOC community.ResumenLos cursos en línea masivos y abiertos (Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC) proporcionan oportunidades ilimitadas para la participación de miles de estudiantes en cursos de enseñanza superior en línea. Los MOOC tienen características únicas que los convierten en un método efectivo del aprendizaje electrónico, en concreto el aprendizaje mejorado por tecnología (Technology-Enhanced Learning, TEL). Numerosas instituciones ofrecen una creciente variedad de MOOC. Sin embargo, existen múltiples retos que deben ser considerados al desarrollar MOOC, por ejemplo, la tasa de abandono de participantes en los cursos es del 95%. Una de las posibles razones para ello es la complejidad y la diversidad de los participantes en los MOOC. Está diversidad no está solamente relacionada con el perfil demográfico y cultural, sino también con los diversos motivos y perspectivas que los usuarios tienen al inscribirse en MOOC. La intención de este artículo es agrupar en dústeres los objetivos de los participantes en MOOC y analizarlos para lograr una mayor comprensión de sus comportamientos. El principal resultado es el descubrimiento de ocho clústeres: aprendizaje mezclado (blended learning), flexibilidad (flexibility), contenido de alta calidad (high quality content), diseño instruccional y metodologías de aprendizaje (instructional design and learning methodologies), aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida (lifelong learning), aprendizaje en red (network learning), apertura (openness) y aprendizaje centrado en el estudiante (student-centered learning). Este esquema de agrupamiento en clústeres crea una visión significativa para la comunidad de participantes en MOOC.",

Recognizing the limitations of standalone MOOCs, blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together have emerged as an alternative MOOC model of teaching and learning in a higher education context. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation details of a bMOOC course on “Teaching Methodologies” at Fayoum University, Egypt in cooperation with RWTH Aachen University, Germany, provided using the bMOOC platform L2P-bMOOC. In order to gauge the usability and effectiveness of the course, we employed an evaluation approach based on Conole’s 12 dimensions rubrics, ISONORM 9241/110-S as a general usability evaluation, and a custom effectiveness questionnaire reflecting the different MOOC stakeholder perspectives.",

We examine, which questions are not yet supported and propose concepts of indicators that have a high potential of positively influencing teachers' didactical considerations. Our investigation shows that many questions of teachers cannot be answered with currently available research tools. Furthermore, few learning analytics studies report about measuring impact.

Durch die immer weiter fortschreitende Digitalisierung in der heutigen Zeit und der zunehmenden Verbreitung mobiler Endgerate erstreckt sich der Kontext, in dem sich ein Lernender bewegt, uber immer mehr Gerate. Neben dem Desktop-PC kommen meist noch ein Smartphone und ein Tablet zum Einsatz. Mit Hilfe von zentralisiert gespeicherten Kontextmodellen, die durch die Nutzung verteilter Gerate gespeist werden, konnen Lernumgebungen in der Generierung von personalisierten Ruckmeldungen unterstutzt werden, ohne dass jede einzelne die benotigten Informationen redundant selbst generieren muss. In diesem Beitrag wird ein Projekt vorgestellt, welches eine Moglichkeit bietet, verteilt erfasste Kontextinformationen zentral abzulegen und in Form eines Kontextmodells abrufbar vorzuhalten.",

One concern with a PLE-driven knowledge-pull approach to learning, however, is information overload. Recommender systems can provide an effective mechanism to deal with the information overload problem in PLEs. In this paper, we study different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation techniques on their applicability and effectiveness in PLE settings. We implement 16 different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, memory based as well as model based, and compare them in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. The results of the conducted offline and user evaluations reveal that the quality of user experience does not correlate with high-recommendation accuracy.",

Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining the indicators that help them achieve their goals.

Due to this diversity in different dimensions of OLA, the LA developers and researchers face numerous challenges while designing solutions for OLA. The Open Learning Analytics Platform (OpenLAP) is a framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for an ecosystem of OLA that aims at supporting learning and teaching in fragmented, diverse, and networked learning environments. It follows a user-centric approach to engage end users in flexible definition and dynamic generation of personalized indicators. In this paper, we address a subset of OLA challenges and present the conceptual and implementation details of the analytics framework component of OpenLAP, which follows a flexible architecture that allows the easy integration of new analytics methods and visualization techniques in OpenLAP to support end users in defining indicators based on their needs in order to embed the results into their personal learning environment.",

Based on this data, learning analytics can perform different analysis and provide personalized and meaningful information to improve the learning and teaching processes. There is a variety of usage data formats that are already successfully used in exiting systems. These different usage data formats have their advantages and disadvantage that have to be considered when using them in the context of learning analytics. In this paper, several usage data formats are presented and analyzed in the context of learning analytics to help in choosing the best suiting usage data model.",

The study identifies three research questions: a) How does activity evolve in these MOOCs? b) Are all learning activities relevant?, and c) Does the use of the target language influence?. We conclude that the MOOC activity drops not only due to the drop-outs. When students skips around 10% of the proposed activities, the percentage of passing the course decrease in a 25%. Forum activity is a useful indicator for success, however the participation in active threads is not. Finally, the use of the target language course is not an indicator to predict success.",

These datasets are used as benchmarks to develop new recommendation algorithms and to compare them to other algorithms in given settings. In this paper, we explore datasets that capture learner interactions with tools and resources. We use the datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms for learning. We present an experimental comparison of the accuracy of several collaborative filtering algorithms applied to these TEL datasets and elaborate on implicit relevance data, such as downloads and tags, that can be used to improve the performance of recommendation algorithms.",

                        "The demands on today\x92s learner have changed over the recent years as the understanding of his role evolved. Getting away from the traditional top-down approaches, the learner is more and more in control of selecting learning resources or choosing the right learning techniques. On the one hand, by following the idea of a learner-centric Personal Learning Environment it is now possible to freely design an own learning environment with all required tools to improve the learning process. On the other hand, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices such as smart phones or tablet computers creates the basis for new modern learning scenarios. While different applications for the devices already allow an individual aggregation of tools they are still highly separated and cannot interact beyond the borders of one application. In this paper, we present a new approach realizing application ecologies on mobile devices which allow integrating services and functionalities of one application into another one. This may happen ad-hoc without involvement of application developers resulting in high extensibility. Furthermore, it allows the user to adjust the app system according to his needs and creates the impression of one seamless mobile PLE consisting of an adjustable set of applications.",

Neben dem Desktop-PC kommen meist noch ein Smartphone und ein Tablet zum Einsatz. Mit Hilfe von zentralisiert gespeicherten Kontextmodellen, die durch die Nutzung verteilter Gerate gespeist werden, konnen Lernumgebungen in der Generierung von personalisierten Ruckmeldungen unterstutzt werden, ohne dass jede einzelne die benotigten Informationen redundant selbst generieren muss. In diesem Beitrag wird ein Projekt vorgestellt, welches eine Moglichkeit bietet, verteilt erfasste Kontextinformationen zentral abzulegen und in Form eines Kontextmodells abrufbar vorzuhalten.",

Recommender systems can provide an effective mechanism to deal with the information overload problem in PLEs. In this paper, we study different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation techniques on their applicability and effectiveness in PLE settings. We implement 16 different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, memory based as well as model based, and compare them in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. The results of the conducted offline and user evaluations reveal that the quality of user experience does not correlate with high-recommendation accuracy.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained a lot of attention in the last years as a new technology enhanced learning (TEL) approach in higher education. MOOCs provide more educational opportunities to a massive number of learners to attend free online courses around the globe. Discussions around MOOCs have been focusing on the potential, social, institutional, technological, relevance, and marketing issues and less on the quality design of MOOC environments. Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories. From these, the learning analytics and assessment categories were found to be the key features for effective MOOCs.",

Recognizing the limitations of standalone MOOCs, blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together have emerged as an alternative MOOC model of teaching and learning in a higher education context. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation details of a bMOOC course on “Teaching Methodologies” at Fayoum University, Egypt in cooperation with RWTH Aachen University, Germany, provided using the bMOOC platform L2P-bMOOC. In order to gauge the usability and effectiveness of the course, we employed an evaluation approach based on Conole’s 12 dimensions rubrics, ISONORM 9241/110-S as a general usability evaluation, and a custom effectiveness questionnaire reflecting the different MOOC stakeholder perspectives.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are providing opportunities for thousands of learners to participate in free higher education courses online. MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning. This cluster schema creates a meaningful picture for the MOOC community.ResumenLos cursos en línea masivos y abiertos (Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC) proporcionan oportunidades ilimitadas para la participación de miles de estudiantes en cursos de enseñanza superior en línea. Los MOOC tienen características únicas que los convierten en un método efectivo del aprendizaje electrónico, en concreto el aprendizaje mejorado por tecnología (Technology-Enhanced Learning, TEL). Numerosas instituciones ofrecen una creciente variedad de MOOC. Sin embargo, existen múltiples retos que deben ser considerados al desarrollar MOOC, por ejemplo, la tasa de abandono de participantes en los cursos es del 95%. Una de las posibles razones para ello es la complejidad y la diversidad de los participantes en los MOOC. Está diversidad no está solamente relacionada con el perfil demográfico y cultural, sino también con los diversos motivos y perspectivas que los usuarios tienen al inscribirse en MOOC. La intención de este artículo es agrupar en dústeres los objetivos de los participantes en MOOC y analizarlos para lograr una mayor comprensión de sus comportamientos. El principal resultado es el descubrimiento de ocho clústeres: aprendizaje mezclado (blended learning), flexibilidad (flexibility), contenido de alta calidad (high quality content), diseño instruccional y metodologías de aprendizaje (instructional design and learning methodologies), aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida (lifelong learning), aprendizaje en red (network learning), apertura (openness) y aprendizaje centrado en el estudiante (student-centered learning). Este esquema de agrupamiento en clústeres crea una visión significativa para la comunidad de participantes en MOOC.",

                    abstract:
                        "Social communication tools in E-Learning have seen monumental growth in the last decade. Blogs as one of the most important tools have a huge contribution in social communication in Learning Management Systems (LMS), and the majority of research incorporating blogs in LMS reveals the effectivity of them. Thus, the quality of blog design becomes the main factor that determines the success of educational blogs. Although a literature review of guidelines and web page standards contain a variety of categories to cover most features of web page design, not all of them can be used to create an effective blog. There is a need to further explore these technologies in educational contexts and identify the criteria of combining them in unit design. The main purpose of this paper is identifying the educational blogs criteria by analysing the literature, research and the reviews of experts in the field. The study outcomes include the final list of blogs criteria which are classified into 6 categories and 80 indicators.",

                    abstract:
                        "Over the past five years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have a remarkable ability to expand access to a large scale of participants worldwide to attend free online courses, beyond the formality of the higher education systems. MOOCs have unique features that support a movement toward a vision of lifelong and on-demand learning for those who are working full time or have taken a break from formal education. Despite their popularity and the large scale participation, a variety of concerns and criticism in the use of MOOCs have been raised. The original concept of MOOCs that aims at breaking down obstacles to education for anyone, anywhere and at any time is far away from the reality. In fact, most MOOC implementations so far still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model. Endeavors to implement bottom-up, student-centered, truly open, decentralized, and distributed forms of MOOCs are exceptions rather than the rule. Moreover, the lack of human interaction is the major limitation of the existing MOOCs. Other limitations of MOOCs include pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback, the lack of interactivity around the video content, as well as the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. Furthermore, a major problem with MOOCs is the ignorance of the importance and benefits of face-toface communication. These limitations raise some serious concerns on what role MOOCs should play, or how they should fit into the higher education landscape as an alternative model of teaching and learning and a substantial supplement. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to shine new light to address these limitations. The new design paradigm of blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together as a blended environment can resolve some of the hurdles facing standalone MOOCs. In fact, the bMOOCs model has the potential to foster student-centered learning, provide effective assessment and feedback, support the interactive design of the video lectures, consider the different patterns of participants in the MOOC, as well as bring the benefits of face-toface interactions into the MOOC environment. This dissertation followed the case study research methodology and the user-centered design approach, in order to design, implement, and evaluate the LP-bMOOC platform. The main contributions are: a theoretical framework that compile and analyze the accumulated literature that has been conducted on Video-Based Learning and MOOCs between 2008 and 2015, a cluster of different patterns of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors, a design dimension and criteria catalogue for effective bMOOC environments, the conceptualization and implementation of the LP-bMOOC platform, an evaluation procedure for usability and effectiveness of bMOOCs, and opportunities for future work in the area of bMOOCs.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are providing opportunities for thousands of learners to participate in free higher education courses online. MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning. This cluster schema creates a meaningful picture for the MOOC community.ResumenLos cursos en línea masivos y abiertos (Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC) proporcionan oportunidades ilimitadas para la participación de miles de estudiantes en cursos de enseñanza superior en línea. Los MOOC tienen características únicas que los convierten en un método efectivo del aprendizaje electrónico, en concreto el aprendizaje mejorado por tecnología (Technology-Enhanced Learning, TEL). Numerosas instituciones ofrecen una creciente variedad de MOOC. Sin embargo, existen múltiples retos que deben ser considerados al desarrollar MOOC, por ejemplo, la tasa de abandono de participantes en los cursos es del 95%. Una de las posibles razones para ello es la complejidad y la diversidad de los participantes en los MOOC. Está diversidad no está solamente relacionada con el perfil demográfico y cultural, sino también con los diversos motivos y perspectivas que los usuarios tienen al inscribirse en MOOC. La intención de este artículo es agrupar en dústeres los objetivos de los participantes en MOOC y analizarlos para lograr una mayor comprensión de sus comportamientos. El principal resultado es el descubrimiento de ocho clústeres: aprendizaje mezclado (blended learning), flexibilidad (flexibility), contenido de alta calidad (high quality content), diseño instruccional y metodologías de aprendizaje (instructional design and learning methodologies), aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida (lifelong learning), aprendizaje en red (network learning), apertura (openness) y aprendizaje centrado en el estudiante (student-centered learning). Este esquema de agrupamiento en clústeres crea una visión significativa para la comunidad de participantes en MOOC.",

Trotz des Potentials neuartiger Wissensmanagementwerkzeuge sind die Arbeitsumgebungen in Firmen größtenteils sehr traditionell. Das zeigt sich sowohl in den Prozessen und Softwarewerkzeugen als auch den gängigen Datenformaten. Am Beispiel des Professional Reflective Mobile Personal Learning Environments (PRiME) Projektes zeigt dieses Paper, wie ein harter Wechsel bei der Einführung eines neuen Wissensmanagementsystems vermieden und somit die Akzeptanz und Erfolgsaussichten deutlich erhöht werden können. Es nutzt die Potentiale bisheriger, traditioneller Arbeitsumgebungen konstruktiv für sich und ermöglicht damit Autoren mit gewohnten Werkzeugen am Lernund Wissensmanagementprozess teilzunehmen. Dazu werden hier die Unterstützung von Autoren bei der formatgerechten Erstellung von Lerninhalten, der automatisierte Transfer von traditionellen Dateiformaten in das Wissensmanagementsystem, sowie die Rückführung von Inhalten aus dem Wissensspeicher in traditionelle Formate thematisiert.",

We discuss two approaches for interest-based recommendation using SNA and compare them with conventional collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation methods. The user evaluation results based on the ResQue framework confirm that SNA-based CF recommendation outperform traditional CF methods in terms of coverage and thus can provide an effective solution to the sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems.",

This resulted in building a web-based prototype that visualizes usage statistics and analytics of the log data extracted from the university-wide learning platform. This prototype contains indicators and visualizations mapped to the goals and perspectives of the identified key user groups, in order to provide insight how the different faculties teach and learn utilizing the platform and provides actionable intelligence to better distribute resources and support the staff and students in their respective blended learning scenarios.",

Generally, LA deals with the development of methods that harness educational data sets to support the learning process. Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining the indicators that help them achieve their goals. In this paper, we address the challenge of personalized LA and present the conceptual, design, and implementation details of a rule-based indicator definition tool to support flexible definition and dynamic generation of indicators to meet the needs of different stakeholders with diverse goals and questions in the LA exercise.",

Our investigation shows that many questions of teachers cannot be answered with currently available research tools. Furthermore, few learning analytics studies report about measuring impact. We describe which effects learning analytics should have on teaching and discuss how this could be evaluated.",

It deals with learning data collected from multiple environments and contexts, analyzed with a wide range of analytics methods to address the requirements of different stakeholders. Due to this diversity in different dimensions of OLA, the LA developers and researchers face numerous challenges while designing solutions for OLA. The Open Learning Analytics Platform (OpenLAP) is a framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for an ecosystem of OLA that aims at supporting learning and teaching in fragmented, diverse, and networked learning environments. It follows a user-centric approach to engage end users in flexible definition and dynamic generation of personalized indicators. In this paper, we address a subset of OLA challenges and present the conceptual and implementation details of the analytics framework component of OpenLAP, which follows a flexible architecture that allows the easy integration of new analytics methods and visualization techniques in OpenLAP to support end users in defining indicators based on their needs in order to embed the results into their personal learning environment.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained a lot of attention in the last years as a new technology enhanced learning (TEL) approach in higher education. MOOCs provide more educational opportunities to a massive number of learners to attend free online courses around the globe. Discussions around MOOCs have been focusing on the potential, social, institutional, technological, relevance, and marketing issues and less on the quality design of MOOC environments. Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories. From these, the learning analytics and assessment categories were found to be the key features for effective MOOCs.",

Its informal and network character, as well as its little half-life demand high standards to record, store and maintain the knowledge which needs to be consider for the development of an appropriate knowledge tool. This paper presents a novel knowledge management system which addresses the scattered, distributed, flexible and interrelated nature of knowledge. It therefore brings different important aspects together and utilizes the personal knowledge management of individuals in working processes together with social collaboration methods for a global organizational learning process. The three reflection layers promote a continuous feedback loop resulting in high quality knowledge maturing. The paper mainly concentrates on the essential underlying architecture and knowledge structure that only makes the learning process possible.

We implemented 21 different recommendation approaches based on traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF), Singular value Decomposition (SVD)-based RS, Trust-based CF, and SNA-based techniques for recommending new collaborators and research topics to the researchers. The evaluation results show that SNA-based recommendation outperforms traditional CF methods in terms of coverage and thus can provide an effective solution to the sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems.",

In this paper, we study different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation techniques on their applicability and effectiveness in PLE settings. We implement 16 different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, memory based as well as model based, and compare them in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. The results of the conducted offline and user evaluations reveal that the quality of user experience does not correlate with high-recommendation accuracy.",

Getting away from the traditional top-down approaches, the learner is more and more in control of selecting learning resources or choosing the right learning techniques. On the one hand, by following the idea of a learner-centric Personal Learning Environment it is now possible to freely design an own learning environment with all required tools to improve the learning process. On the other hand, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices such as smart phones or tablet computers creates the basis for new modern learning scenarios. While different applications for the devices already allow an individual aggregation of tools they are still highly separated and cannot interact beyond the borders of one application. In this paper, we present a new approach realizing application ecologies on mobile devices which allow integrating services and functionalities of one application into another one. This may happen ad-hoc without involvement of application developers resulting in high extensibility. Furthermore, it allows the user to adjust the app system according to his needs and creates the impression of one seamless mobile PLE consisting of an adjustable set of applications.",

In the past decade, the interest in VBL has increased as a result of new forms of online education, such as flipped classrooms, and most prominently MOOCs. VBL has unique features that make it an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. This study critically analyzed the current research of VBL published in 2003-2013 to build a deep understanding on what are the educational benefits and effectiveness that VBL has on teaching and learning. 67 peer reviewed papers were selected in this review and categorized into four main dimensions, namely, effectiveness, teaching methods, design, and reflection. In the light of the discussion of current research in terms of these categories, we present the future vision and research opportunities of VBL that support self-organized and network learning.",

Recognizing the limitations of standalone MOOCs, blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together have emerged as an alternative MOOC model of teaching and learning in a higher education context. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation details of a bMOOC course on “Teaching Methodologies” at Fayoum University, Egypt in cooperation with RWTH Aachen University, Germany, provided using the bMOOC platform L2P-bMOOC. In order to gauge the usability and effectiveness of the course, we employed an evaluation approach based on Conole’s 12 dimensions rubrics, ISONORM 9241/110-S as a general usability evaluation, and a custom effectiveness questionnaire reflecting the different MOOC stakeholder perspectives.",

The prototype has three parts: data management, RESTful application engine, and user interface(s). The data management receives, cleans, analyzes and aggregates the learning platform logs, and saves the derived results and analytics. The RESTful application engine is a Web API application that provides data and analytics to the front-end (UI). The user interface provides a set of visualizations, which interactively presents the learning data for different stakeholders in higher education scenarios. The user interface has two main aspects. The first is intended for the university’s administration and eLearning coordinators, in order to help in understanding how different faculties and institutes use the learning platform. The second aspect focuses on individual courses, where the teaching staff and students can take a look which modules, when, and how were used during the ongoing semester(s). The presented work is an ongoing research project at the Learning Technologies Research Group at RWTH Aachen University.",

                        "Open learning analytics (OLA) is a relatively new branch of learning analytics (LA) which emerged due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. OLA deals with learning data collected from various learning environments and contexts, analyzed with a range of analytics methods, and for different stakeholders with diverse interests and objectives. This diversity in different dimensions of OLA is a challenge which needs to be addressed by adopting a personalized learning analytics (PLA) model. Current implementations of LA mainly rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators which is not suitable in the context of OLA where the indicators are unpredictable. In this paper we present the goal question indicator (GQI) approach for PLA and provide the conceptual, design, implementation and evaluation details of the indicator engine component of the open learning analytics platform (OpenLAP) that engages end users in the indicator generation process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining",

                        "Modern day education and learning has moved on from brick and mortar institutions to open learning environments. This recent shift in education has had its effects on the field of assessment and feedback as well. The traditional methods of assessment are being replaced by new methods from the field of open assessment. One such assessment method for open learning environments is peer assessment. Peer assessment is a crowd sourcing technique which lessens the teacher workload and gives students a voice in the assessment process. Despite being the leading assessment method in open learning environments, the tools available for peer assessment are lagging far behind. Most peer assessment tools are context and domain specific which hinders their uniform adoption across different fields of study. This paper introduces the core peer assessment module in the Peer Assessment & Learning Assessment System (PALAS). The module is a flexible, customizable and multi-dimensional peer assessment system which allows the teachers to configure the peer assessment process according to their liking and requirements without any changes required to the system design.",

One concern with knowledge-pull approaches is knowledge overload. Thus, there is a crucial need for knowledge filters to help learners cope with the problem of knowledge overload. In this paper, we present the details of PLEM as a Web 2.0 driven service for personal learning management, which acts as a knowledge filter for learning. The primary aim of PLEM is to harness the collective intelligence and leverage social filtering methods to help learners find quality knowledge nodes that can populate their PLEs.",

                        "The demands on today\x92s learner have changed over the recent years as the understanding of his role evolved. Getting away from the traditional top-down approaches, the learner is more and more in control of selecting learning resources or choosing the right learning techniques. On the one hand, by following the idea of a learner-centric Personal Learning Environment it is now possible to freely design an own learning environment with all required tools to improve the learning process. On the other hand, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices such as smart phones or tablet computers creates the basis for new modern learning scenarios. While different applications for the devices already allow an individual aggregation of tools they are still highly separated and cannot interact beyond the borders of one application. In this paper, we present a new approach realizing application ecologies on mobile devices which allow integrating services and functionalities of one application into another one. This may happen ad-hoc without involvement of application developers resulting in high extensibility. Furthermore, it allows the user to adjust the app system according to his needs and creates the impression of one seamless mobile PLE consisting of an adjustable set of applications.",

Hence, while dealing with problems like the demographic change, organizations are trying to preserve the knowledge of their members. Its informal and network character, as well as its little half-life demand high standards to record, store and maintain the knowledge which needs to be consider for the development of an appropriate knowledge tool. This paper presents a novel knowledge management system which addresses the scattered, distributed, flexible and interrelated nature of knowledge. It therefore brings different important aspects together and utilizes the personal knowledge management of individuals in working processes together with social collaboration methods for a global organizational learning process. The three reflection layers promote a continuous feedback loop resulting in high quality knowledge maturing. The paper mainly concentrates on the essential underlying architecture and knowledge structure that only makes the learning process possible.

In this paper, we investigate interest-based recommendation in academic networks using social network analytics (SNA) methods. We implemented 21 different recommendation approaches based on traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF), Singular value Decomposition (SVD)-based RS, Trust-based CF, and SNA-based techniques for recommending new collaborators and research topics to the researchers. The evaluation results show that SNA-based recommendation outperforms traditional CF methods in terms of coverage and thus can provide an effective solution to the sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems.",

In this paper, we study different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation techniques on their applicability and effectiveness in PLE settings. We implement 16 different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, memory based as well as model based, and compare them in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction.

                        "Over the past five years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have a remarkable ability to expand access to a large scale of participants worldwide to attend free online courses, beyond the formality of the higher education systems. MOOCs have unique features that support a movement toward a vision of lifelong and on-demand learning for those who are working full time or have taken a break from formal education. Despite their popularity and the large scale participation, a variety of concerns and criticism in the use of MOOCs have been raised. The original concept of MOOCs that aims at breaking down obstacles to education for anyone, anywhere and at any time is far away from the reality. In fact, most MOOC implementations so far still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model. Endeavors to implement bottom-up, student-centered, truly open, decentralized, and distributed forms of MOOCs are exceptions rather than the rule. Moreover, the lack of human interaction is the major limitation of the existing MOOCs. Other limitations of MOOCs include pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback, the lack of interactivity around the video content, as well as the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. Furthermore, a major problem with MOOCs is the ignorance of the importance and benefits of face-toface communication. These limitations raise some serious concerns on what role MOOCs should play, or how they should fit into the higher education landscape as an alternative model of teaching and learning and a substantial supplement. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to shine new light to address these limitations. The new design paradigm of blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together as a blended environment can resolve some of the hurdles facing standalone MOOCs. In fact, the bMOOCs model has the potential to foster student-centered learning, provide effective assessment and feedback, support the interactive design of the video lectures, consider the different patterns of participants in the MOOC, as well as bring the benefits of face-toface interactions into the MOOC environment. This dissertation followed the case study research methodology and the user-centered design approach, in order to design, implement, and evaluate the LP-bMOOC platform. The main contributions are: a theoretical framework that compile and analyze the accumulated literature that has been conducted on Video-Based Learning and MOOCs between 2008 and 2015, a cluster of different patterns of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors, a design dimension and criteria catalogue for effective bMOOC environments, the conceptualization and implementation of the LP-bMOOC platform, an evaluation procedure for usability and effectiveness of bMOOCs, and opportunities for future work in the area of bMOOCs.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained a lot of attention in the last years as a new technology enhanced learning (TEL) approach in higher education. MOOCs provide more educational opportunities to a massive number of learners to attend free online courses around the globe. Discussions around MOOCs have been focusing on the potential, social, institutional, technological, relevance, and marketing issues and less on the quality design of MOOC environments. Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories. From these, the learning analytics and assessment categories were found to be the key features for effective MOOCs.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are providing opportunities for thousands of learners to participate in free higher education courses online. MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning. This cluster schema creates a meaningful picture for the MOOC community.ResumenLos cursos en línea masivos y abiertos (Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC) proporcionan oportunidades ilimitadas para la participación de miles de estudiantes en cursos de enseñanza superior en línea. Los MOOC tienen características únicas que los convierten en un método efectivo del aprendizaje electrónico, en concreto el aprendizaje mejorado por tecnología (Technology-Enhanced Learning, TEL). Numerosas instituciones ofrecen una creciente variedad de MOOC. Sin embargo, existen múltiples retos que deben ser considerados al desarrollar MOOC, por ejemplo, la tasa de abandono de participantes en los cursos es del 95%. Una de las posibles razones para ello es la complejidad y la diversidad de los participantes en los MOOC. Está diversidad no está solamente relacionada con el perfil demográfico y cultural, sino también con los diversos motivos y perspectivas que los usuarios tienen al inscribirse en MOOC. La intención de este artículo es agrupar en dústeres los objetivos de los participantes en MOOC y analizarlos para lograr una mayor comprensión de sus comportamientos. El principal resultado es el descubrimiento de ocho clústeres: aprendizaje mezclado (blended learning), flexibilidad (flexibility), contenido de alta calidad (high quality content), diseño instruccional y metodologías de aprendizaje (instructional design and learning methodologies), aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida (lifelong learning), aprendizaje en red (network learning), apertura (openness) y aprendizaje centrado en el estudiante (student-centered learning). Este esquema de agrupamiento en clústeres crea una visión significativa para la comunidad de participantes en MOOC.",

                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are providing opportunities for thousands of learners to participate in free higher education courses online. MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning. This cluster schema creates a meaningful picture for the MOOC community.ResumenLos cursos en línea masivos y abiertos (Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC) proporcionan oportunidades ilimitadas para la participación de miles de estudiantes en cursos de enseñanza superior en línea. Los MOOC tienen características únicas que los convierten en un método efectivo del aprendizaje electrónico, en concreto el aprendizaje mejorado por tecnología (Technology-Enhanced Learning, TEL). Numerosas instituciones ofrecen una creciente variedad de MOOC. Sin embargo, existen múltiples retos que deben ser considerados al desarrollar MOOC, por ejemplo, la tasa de abandono de participantes en los cursos es del 95%. Una de las posibles razones para ello es la complejidad y la diversidad de los participantes en los MOOC. Está diversidad no está solamente relacionada con el perfil demográfico y cultural, sino también con los diversos motivos y perspectivas que los usuarios tienen al inscribirse en MOOC. La intención de este artículo es agrupar en dústeres los objetivos de los participantes en MOOC y analizarlos para lograr una mayor comprensión de sus comportamientos. El principal resultado es el descubrimiento de ocho clústeres: aprendizaje mezclado (blended learning), flexibilidad (flexibility), contenido de alta calidad (high quality content), diseño instruccional y metodologías de aprendizaje (instructional design and learning methodologies), aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida (lifelong learning), aprendizaje en red (network learning), apertura (openness) y aprendizaje centrado en el estudiante (student-centered learning). Este esquema de agrupamiento en clústeres crea una visión significativa para la comunidad de participantes en MOOC.",

                    abstract:
                        "Over the past five years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have a remarkable ability to expand access to a large scale of participants worldwide to attend free online courses, beyond the formality of the higher education systems. MOOCs have unique features that support a movement toward a vision of lifelong and on-demand learning for those who are working full time or have taken a break from formal education. Despite their popularity and the large scale participation, a variety of concerns and criticism in the use of MOOCs have been raised. The original concept of MOOCs that aims at breaking down obstacles to education for anyone, anywhere and at any time is far away from the reality. In fact, most MOOC implementations so far still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model. Endeavors to implement bottom-up, student-centered, truly open, decentralized, and distributed forms of MOOCs are exceptions rather than the rule. Moreover, the lack of human interaction is the major limitation of the existing MOOCs. Other limitations of MOOCs include pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback, the lack of interactivity around the video content, as well as the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. Furthermore, a major problem with MOOCs is the ignorance of the importance and benefits of face-toface communication. These limitations raise some serious concerns on what role MOOCs should play, or how they should fit into the higher education landscape as an alternative model of teaching and learning and a substantial supplement. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to shine new light to address these limitations. The new design paradigm of blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together as a blended environment can resolve some of the hurdles facing standalone MOOCs. In fact, the bMOOCs model has the potential to foster student-centered learning, provide effective assessment and feedback, support the interactive design of the video lectures, consider the different patterns of participants in the MOOC, as well as bring the benefits of face-toface interactions into the MOOC environment. This dissertation followed the case study research methodology and the user-centered design approach, in order to design, implement, and evaluate the LP-bMOOC platform. The main contributions are: a theoretical framework that compile and analyze the accumulated literature that has been conducted on Video-Based Learning and MOOCs between 2008 and 2015, a cluster of different patterns of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors, a design dimension and criteria catalogue for effective bMOOC environments, the conceptualization and implementation of the LP-bMOOC platform, an evaluation procedure for usability and effectiveness of bMOOCs, and opportunities for future work in the area of bMOOCs.",

                    abstract:
                        "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained a lot of attention in the last years as a new technology enhanced learning (TEL) approach in higher education. MOOCs provide more educational opportunities to a massive number of learners to attend free online courses around the globe. Discussions around MOOCs have been focusing on the potential, social, institutional, technological, relevance, and marketing issues and less on the quality design of MOOC environments. Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories. From these, the learning analytics and assessment categories were found to be the key features for effective MOOCs.",

Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining the indicators that help them achieve their goals. In this paper, we address the challenge of personalized LA and present the conceptual, design, and implementation details of a rule-based indicator definition tool to support flexible definition and dynamic generation of indicators to meet the needs of different stakeholders with diverse goals and questions in the LA exercise.",

We examine, which questions are not yet supported and propose concepts of indicators that have a high potential of positively influencing teachers' didactical considerations. Our investigation shows that many questions of teachers cannot be answered with currently available research tools. Furthermore, few learning analytics studies report about measuring impact. We describe which effects learning analytics should have on teaching and discuss how this could be evaluated.",
