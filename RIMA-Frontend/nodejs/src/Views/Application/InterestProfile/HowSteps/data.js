There is a need to shift from one-size-fits-all systems to personalized learning environments that give control to the learners. Recently, learning analytics (LA) is opening up new opportunities for promoting personalization by providing insights and understanding into how learners learn and supporting customized learning experiences that meet their goals and needs. This paper discusses the Personalization and Learning Analytics (PERLA) framework which represents the convergence of personalization and learning analytics and provides a theoretical foundation for effective analytics-enhanced personalized learning. The main aim of the PERLA framework is to guide the systematic design and development of effective indicators for personalized learning.",

This recent shift in education has had its effects on the field of assessment and feedback as well. The traditional methods of assessment are being replaced by new methods from the field of open assessment. One such assessment method for open learning environments is peer assessment. Peer assessment is a crowd sourcing technique which lessens the teacher workload and gives students a voice in the assessment process. Despite being the leading assessment method in open learning environments, the tools available for peer assessment are lagging far behind. Most peer assessment tools are context and domain specific which hinders their uniform adoption across different fields of study. This paper introduces the core peer assessment module in the Peer Assessment & Learning Assessment System (PALAS). The module is a flexible, customizable and multi-dimensional peer assessment system which allows the teachers to configure the peer assessment process according to their liking and requirements without any changes required to the system design.",

In this paper we present the goal question indicator (GQI) approach for PLA and provide the conceptual, design, implementation and evaluation details of the indicator engine component of the open learning analytics platform (OpenLAP) that engages end users in the indicator generation process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining",

It deals with learning data collected from multiple environments and contexts, analyzed with a wide range of analytics methods to address the requirements of different stakeholders. Due to this diversity in different dimensions of OLA, the LA developers and researchers face numerous challenges while designing solutions for OLA. The Open Learning Analytics Platform (OpenLAP) is a framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for an ecosystem of OLA that aims at supporting learning and teaching in fragmented, diverse, and networked learning environments. It follows a user-centric approach to engage end users in flexible definition and dynamic generation of personalized indicators. In this paper, we address a subset of OLA challenges and present the conceptual and implementation details of the analytics framework component of OpenLAP, which follows a flexible architecture that allows the easy integration of new analytics methods and visualization techniques in OpenLAP to support end users in defining indicators based on their needs in order to embed the results into their personal learning environment.",

It discusses the development of EDUSS, a conceptual framework for self-actualization goals of transparent user modeling. Drawing from a qualitative research approach, the framework investigates self-actualization from psychology and computer science disciplines and derives a set of self-actualization goals and mechanisms. Following a human-centered design (HCD) approach, the framework was applied in an iterative process to systematically design a set of interactive visualizations to help users achieve different self-actualization goals in the scientific research domain. For this purpose, an explainable user interest model within a recommender system is utilized to provide various information on how the interest models are generated from users’ publication data. The main contributions are threefold: First, a synthesis of research on self-actualization from different domains. Second, EDUSS, a theoretically-sound self-actualization framework for transparent user modeling consisting of five main goals, namely, Explore, Develop, Understand, Scrutinize, and Socialize. Third, an instantiation of the proposed framework to effectively design interactive visualizations that can support the different self-actualization goals, following an HCD approach.",

To fill this research gap, we aim in this paper at a shift from a one-size-fits-all to a personalized approach to explainable recommendation by giving users agency in deciding which explanation they would like to see.

We conducted a within-subject study (N=31) to investigate the relationship between user’s personal characteristics and the explanation level of detail, and the effects of these two variables on the perception of the explainable RS with regard to different explanation goals.

This recent shift in education has had its effects on the field of assessment and feedback as well. The traditional methods of assessment are being replaced by new methods from the field of open assessment. One such assessment method for open learning environments is peer assessment. Peer assessment is a crowd sourcing technique which lessens the teacher workload and gives students a voice in the assessment process. Despite being the leading assessment method in open learning environments, the tools available for peer assessment are lagging far behind. Most peer assessment tools are context and domain specific which hinders their uniform adoption across different fields of study. This paper introduces the core peer assessment module in the Peer Assessment & Learning Assessment System (PALAS). The module is a flexible, customizable and multi-dimensional peer assessment system which allows the teachers to configure the peer assessment process according to their liking and requirements without any changes required to the system design.",

It deals with learning data collected from multiple environments and contexts, analyzed with a wide range of analytics methods to address the requirements of different stakeholders. Due to this diversity in different dimensions of OLA, the LA developers and researchers face numerous challenges while designing solutions for OLA. The Open Learning Analytics Platform (OpenLAP) is a framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for an ecosystem of OLA that aims at supporting learning and teaching in fragmented, diverse, and networked learning environments. It follows a user-centric approach to engage end users in flexible definition and dynamic generation of personalized indicators. In this paper, we address a subset of OLA challenges and present the conceptual and implementation details of the analytics framework component of OpenLAP, which follows a flexible architecture that allows the easy integration of new analytics methods and visualization techniques in OpenLAP to support end users in defining indicators based on their needs in order to embed the results into their personal learning environment.",

There is a need to shift from one-size-fits-all systems to personalized learning environments that give control to the learners. Recently, learning analytics (LA) is opening up new opportunities for promoting personalization by providing insights and understanding into how learners learn and supporting customized learning experiences that meet their goals and needs. This paper discusses the Personalization and Learning Analytics (PERLA) framework which represents the convergence of personalization and learning analytics and provides a theoretical foundation for effective analytics-enhanced personalized learning. The main aim of the PERLA framework is to guide the systematic design and development of effective indicators for personalized learning.",

To fill this research gap, we aim in this paper at a shift from a one-size-fits-all to a personalized approach to explainable recommendation by giving users agency in deciding which explanation they would like to see. We developed a transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA) that provides on-demand personalized explanations of the recommendations, with three levels of detail (basic, intermediate, advanced) to meet the demands of different types of end-users. We conducted a within-subject study (N=31) to investigate the relationship between user’s personal characteristics and the explanation level of detail, and the effects of these two variables on the perception of the explainable RS with regard to different explanation goals. Our results show that the perception of explainable RS with different levels of detail is affected to different degrees by the explanation goal and user type.

To address this gap, we propose the transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA) that aims at opening, scrutinizing, and explaining the user’s interest model based on three levels of details. The results of a preliminary interview-based user study demonstrated potential benefits in terms of transparency, scrutability, and user satisfaction with the explainable recommender system.",

It discusses the development of EDUSS, a conceptual framework for self-actualization goals of transparent user modeling. Drawing from a qualitative research approach, the framework investigates self-actualization from psychology and computer science disciplines and derives a set of self-actualization goals and mechanisms. Following a human-centered design (HCD) approach, the framework was applied in an iterative process to systematically design a set of interactive visualizations to help users achieve different self-actualization goals in the scientific research domain. For this purpose, an explainable user interest model within a recommender system is utilized to provide various information on how the interest models are generated from users’ publication data. The main contributions are threefold: First, a synthesis of research on self-actualization from different domains. Second, EDUSS, a theoretically-sound self-actualization framework for transparent user modeling consisting of five main goals, namely, Explore, Develop, Understand, Scrutinize, and Socialize. Third, an instantiation of the proposed framework to effectively design interactive visualizations that can support the different self-actualization goals, following an HCD approach.",

This recent shift in education has had its effects on the field of assessment and feedback as well. The traditional methods of assessment are being replaced by new methods from the field of open assessment. One such assessment method for open learning environments is peer assessment. Peer assessment is a crowd sourcing technique which lessens the teacher workload and gives students a voice in the assessment process. Despite being the leading assessment method in open learning environments, the tools available for peer assessment are lagging far behind. Most peer assessment tools are context and domain specific which hinders their uniform adoption across different fields of study. This paper introduces the core peer assessment module in the Peer Assessment & Learning Assessment System (PALAS). The module is a flexible, customizable and multi-dimensional peer assessment system which allows the teachers to configure the peer assessment process according to their liking and requirements without any changes required to the system design.",

There is a need to shift from one-size-fits-all systems to personalized learning environments that give control to the learners. Recently, learning analytics (LA) is opening up new opportunities for promoting personalization by providing insights and understanding into how learners learn and supporting customized learning experiences that meet their goals and needs. This paper discusses the Personalization and Learning Analytics (PERLA) framework which represents the convergence of personalization and learning analytics and provides a theoretical foundation for effective analytics-enhanced personalized learning. The main aim of the PERLA framework is to guide the systematic design and development of effective indicators for personalized learning.",

OLA deals with learning data collected from various learning environments and contexts, analyzed with a range of analytics methods, and for different stakeholders with diverse interests and objectives. This diversity in different dimensions of OLA is a challenge which needs to be addressed by adopting a personalized learning analytics (PLA) model. Current implementations of LA mainly rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators which is not suitable in the context of OLA where the indicators are unpredictable. In this paper we present the goal question indicator (GQI) approach for PLA and provide the conceptual, design, implementation and evaluation details of the indicator engine component of the open learning analytics platform (OpenLAP) that engages end users in the indicator generation process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining",

It discusses the development of EDUSS, a conceptual framework for self-actualization goals of transparent user modeling. Drawing from a qualitative research approach, the framework investigates self-actualization from psychology and computer science disciplines and derives a set of self-actualization goals and mechanisms. Following a human-centered design (HCD) approach, the framework was applied in an iterative process to systematically design a set of interactive visualizations to help users achieve different self-actualization goals in the scientific research domain. For this purpose, an explainable user interest model within a recommender system is utilized to provide various information on how the interest models are generated from users’ publication data. The main contributions are threefold: First, a synthesis of research on self-actualization from different domains. Second, EDUSS, a theoretically-sound self-actualization framework for transparent user modeling consisting of five main goals, namely, Explore, Develop, Understand, Scrutinize, and Socialize. Third, an instantiation of the proposed framework to effectively design interactive visualizations that can support the different self-actualization goals, following an HCD approach.",

OLA deals with learning data collected from various learning environments and contexts, analyzed with a range of analytics methods, and for different stakeholders with diverse interests and objectives. This diversity in different dimensions of OLA is a challenge which needs to be addressed by adopting a personalized learning analytics (PLA) model. Current implementations of LA mainly rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators which is not suitable in the context of OLA where the indicators are unpredictable. In this paper we present the goal question indicator (GQI) approach for PLA and provide the conceptual, design, implementation and evaluation details of the indicator engine component of the open learning analytics platform (OpenLAP) that engages end users in the indicator generation process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining",

It discusses the development of EDUSS, a conceptual framework for self-actualization goals of transparent user modeling. Drawing from a qualitative research approach, the framework investigates self-actualization from psychology and computer science disciplines and derives a set of self-actualization goals and mechanisms. Following a human-centered design (HCD) approach, the framework was applied in an iterative process to systematically design a set of interactive visualizations to help users achieve different self-actualization goals in the scientific research domain. For this purpose, an explainable user interest model within a recommender system is utilized to provide various information on how the interest models are generated from users’ publication data. The main contributions are threefold: First, a synthesis of research on self-actualization from different domains. Second, EDUSS, a theoretically-sound self-actualization framework for transparent user modeling consisting of five main goals, namely, Explore, Develop, Understand, Scrutinize, and Socialize. Third, an instantiation of the proposed framework to effectively design interactive visualizations that can support the different self-actualization goals, following an HCD approach.",
